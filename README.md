This repository contains the scripts used in the manuscript: *Normal Breast Tissues Harbor Rare Populations of Aneuploid Epithelial Cells*.


#### scDNA data analysis 
- Demultiplexed fastq files were first pre-processed by the pipeline: [_CNV_pipeline_](https://github.com/navinlabcode/CNV_pipeline).
- Then R scripts in _scDNA_analysis_ were used for downstream analysis and visualization. 

#### Statistical analysis 
- R scripts in _stat_analysis_ were used for statistical testing and visualization.

#### Spatial transcriptomic analysis
-
